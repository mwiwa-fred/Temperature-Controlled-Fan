# Temperature-Controlled Fan System

This project controls a fan based on temperature readings using an ESP32. 

## Components Required
- ESP32 Development Board
- 1 Fan (DC)
- 1 Status LED (Red)
- 1 Resistor (for LED)
- Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35 or DHT11/DHT22)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Complete the code in `TempControlledFan.ino` based on the following tasks:
   - Implement reading the temperature from the sensor.
   - Control the fan based on a temperature threshold of 30Â°C.
   - Include a status LED that indicates when the fan is on.
   - Add comments explaining your logic and code structure.
3. Commit your changes to a new branch named after you.
4. Push the changes and create a pull request with a clear description of what you modified.

## NB: if you dont have a fan, you can use an LED to indicate when the fan would be on.
